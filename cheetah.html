                   <h3>CHEETAH</h3>
                   <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is one of the most graceful members of the cat family, and  one of the few cat species which relies on speed instead of stealth when hunting. Cheetahs are in fact the fastest land mammals on Earth, reaching speeds of 110-120 km/h. They accelerate from 0 to 80 km/h in just three seconds, which is faster than any sports car. The only animals faster are the peregrine falcon, which can dive at speeds of 300 km/h and the tiger beetle, which if it was as large as a human, could run at speeds of 494 km/h.



Cheetahs originate from a puma ancestor and date back approximately 4.9 million years. The name cheetah comes from the term "Chitraka", which means "speckled" in the ancient Indian language of Sanskrit.â€‹

Cheetahs rely on sight to detect their prey and are therefore more active during the day; their distinctive tear marks, running from the inside of the eye to the corner of their mouth, help to keep sunlight away from their eyes. In summertime, they are more active early morning and late afternoon, and they will rest in shade during the hottest hours of the day. This helps them to avoid larger predators which hunt at night.</p>
                   <p><Cheetahs are frequently observed in savannahs, dry and scrub forests, and grasslands. These predators used to cover a much wider area than they currently range. This suggests that cheetahs may have inhabited more habitats, but have since been driven out./p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE DO WE FIND THEM ?</strong></p>
                   <P>Cheetahs are found across Africa, primarily in northern Africa; the Sahel (the transition region between the Sahara to the north and the Sudanian Savanna to the south); and they are scattered across eastern and southern Africa, according to the Smithsonian.</P>
