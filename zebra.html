                   <h3>ZEBRA</h3>
                   <p>Zebras have black fur with white stripes and predominantly white bellies. Their feet are capped with a singular, hard hoof, which packs a punch when kicked at predators. They have large, rounded ears with lots of hair to keep dust out of them. Their tail has long, black hair that begins approximately midway down the tail, while the top is striped</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE DO WE FIND THEM ?</strong></p>
                   <P>Though they all live in Africa, each species of zebra has its own home area. Plains zebras live in the treeless grasslands and woodlands of eastern and southern Africa. The Grevy's zebra lives in in the arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. The mountain zebra is found in South Africa, Namibia and Angola.</P>
