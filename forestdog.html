                   <h3>FOREST DOG (COYOTE)</h3>
                   <p>Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. ... Coyote tracks can be distinguished from those of dogs by their more elongated, less rounded shape.</p>
                   <p>Coyotes are territorial, and both members of a breeding pair defend the territory against other coyotes. Territories are marked with urine and feces, and it is believed that howling may serve to indicate occupancy of a territory. The size of coyote territories varies among habitats and also depends on its abundance of prey. Most territories, however, range from 10 to 40 square km (4 to 15 square miles).</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE DO WE FIND THEM ?</strong></p>
                   <P>Coyotes live in North America and roam the plains, forests, mountains and deserts of Canada, the United States, Mexico and Central America. Some even live in tropical climates. As humans take over more and more countryside, coyotes are adapting to living in cities to find food</P>
