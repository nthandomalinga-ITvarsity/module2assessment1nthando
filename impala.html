                   <h3>IMPALA</h3>
                   <p>The optimal habitat for tigers is located close to a water source, has lots of vegetation for cover while hunting, and plenty of prey. These are solitary hunters, so having the ability to hide in tall grasses and bushes while stalking prey is of the utmost importance.

They also prefer living in habitats with suitable den locations, such as caves, hollow trees, or very dense bushes. Different subspecies can be found in a number of forest types, including evergreen, swamp, mangrove, deciduous, thorn, and taiga. They will also occasionally inhabit rocky mountain habitats, as well as savannas and grasslands.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE DO WE FIND THEM ?</strong></p>
                   <P>Tigers are found in amazingly diverse habitats: rain forests, grasslands, savannas and even mangrove swamps. Unfortunately, 93% of historical tiger lands have disappeared primarily because of expanding human activity.</P>
